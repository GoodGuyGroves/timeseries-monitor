## Checkram


### Usage

Once data is collected, edit "ram.plot" in the "Example" folder to include the titles and axis text you'd like then run `gnuplot` and then from within gnuplot execute `load ram.plot` to graph your data.


### To do

At some point I'll probably wrap this process better with a script but not just yet. :)
